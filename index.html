      YOOOOOOO hello!
      
      We're creative. We're curious. We're students. We love computer science. We're from Ladue. The rest is left as an exercise to the reader. There will be a test at the end.
      <span class="username">guest</span><span class="hostname">@laduecs.github.io</span><span class="directory"> ~</span><span class="prompt">> </span><span class="command">cat about</span>
      We're Ladue's one and only computer science club! (LMAO Robotics kids as they furiously fake-code lmaaaaaaaoooo)
      
      We do FUN STUFF. Like really FUN STUFF. So FUN that you'll quit all your other clubs to do our FUN stuff. Seriously, come check out our FUN STUFF. This is not meant to be sinister. The next one is...
      
      You'll meet 300 IQ people and even better, learn their secret dark tricks! >:)

      You'll go through the stages of programming enlightenment: 0) Scratch lmao 1) Basic Python and HTML/CSS/JS 2) Git, Bash, Linux, FUNctional programming 3) Fake news bots, binary exploitation, BSD, non-backdoored RNG, commodity supercomputers 4) World domination √† la Google/Instametabook 5) How to get a better night's sleep after coding in front of your computer for the past 40 hours continuously. Let's get started!
